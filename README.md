# Diabetetes-Prediction-Models
Used the Pima Indian Diabetes data set to build models for predicting Diabetes. Applied supervised, unsupervised and deep learning algorithms for building the models. Also explored the possibility of using Principal Component Analysis for dimension reduction. Achieved an accuracy of 82% and an F1 score of 75% by tuning the hyperparameters of an Artificial Neural Network (ANN).

Diabetes_Prediction_Project.ipynb: IPython notebook with all the codes for analyszing, pre-processing, visualizing and applying prediction models on the data set.
